            remember more, for longer and better connect learning across subjects.</p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <section class="study-skills">
            <div class="skill">
                <h2>Retrieval Practice</h2>
                <p>The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice
                tests, actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each
                other.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skill">
                <h2>Spaced Practice</h2>
                <p>This simple method of spacing out your studying makes a big difference in helping to
                    form lasting memories.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skill">
                <h2>Elaboration</h2>
                <p>Use your own words and add details to the concepts you’re learning to make them your
                    own and make it easier to recall them later.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skill">
                <h2>Interleaving</h2>
                <p>Instead of studying the same things in the same order over and over, try mixing things
                    up with Interleaving.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="skill">
                <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
                <p>It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already
                    know. Learning and creating specific examples of abstract concepts does just that.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="skill">
                <h2>Dual Coding</h2>
                <p>Combine visuals like pictures, diagrams or your own drawings, with text gives your brain
                    more to latch on to and more pathways to remember.</p>

            <h1>Featured Skill: Retrieval Practice</h1>
            <p>Retrieval Practice is one of the most effective skills and you can use it for multiple subjects. It’s
            a great place to start trying out the skills on this site.</p>
