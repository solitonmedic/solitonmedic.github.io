            <div class="skill">Retrieval Practice
                The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice
                tests, actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each
                other.

            <div class="skill">
                <h2>Spaced Practice</h2>
                This simple method of spacing out your studying makes a big difference in helping to
                form lasting memories.
            </div>
            <div class="skill">
                <h2>Elaboration</h2>
                Use your own words and add details to the concepts you’re learning to make them your
                own and make it easier to recall them later.
            </div>
            <div class="skill">Interleaving
                Instead of studying the same things in the same order over and over, try mixing things
                up with Interleaving.</div>
            <div class="skill">Concrete Examples
                It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already
                know. Learning and creating specific examples of abstract concepts does just that.
            </div>
            <div class="skill">Dual Coding
                Combine visuals like pictures, diagrams or your own drawings, with text gives your brain
                more to latch on to and more pathways to remember.
